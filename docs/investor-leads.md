```
GeoInvesting has worked diligently over the last decade to understand and benefit from working in areas that the Wall Street “crowd” has avoided – namely, microcap stocks. This niche of the market, while mostly ignored by analysts and financial media, is still often quietly invested in by many well-known billionaires. We apply our own deep-dive analysis in the space to find pockets of information arbitrage and unnoticed opportunities that have acted as the backbone for our investing success for over a decade. Unlike some investment banks and sell-side analysts, we don’t get paid by companies to write about them.

Armed with over a dozen analysts and a team of on the ground due diligence experts led by Maj Soueidan’s three decades of full-time investing experience, coupled with real-time data from our fintech partner Sentieo, GeoInvesting gives you the power to evaluate educated investing decisions with confidence. Whether you’re an experienced investor looking for high-impact idea generation or just looking to broaden your knowledge of investing, GeoInvesting can help with actionable insights on a wide array of stocks.

Since GeoInvesting’s inception in 2007, we’ve been helping investors understand companies better by interviewing management teams, dissecting conference calls, interacting with our wide network of investors and scouring financial documents for hidden clues. GeoInvesting provides quick, concise and efficient research instead hundreds of pages of meaningless boilerplate jargon to pour through. You will no longer have to sift through these documents to find the most relevant aspects of a company’s operations, results and guidance – that’s our promise.
