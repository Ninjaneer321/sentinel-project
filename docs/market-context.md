Great thank you for that, lets finish out the details of the business plan, so that it is the most accurate to match what we have planned for the project. From now own we call give this project the title "The Sentinel Project", I will sometimes refer to it as "TSP"

As a reference, here is a recent article discussing Cybersecurity in 2021 and 2023. We want to make the numbers as accurate, so that we have the correct evaluations and predictions

# Cybersecurity Growth Rate Overview and Predictions for 2021 - 2023

The global cyber security market was valued at USD 202.72 billion in 2022 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.3% from 2023 to 2030. The increasing number of cyber-attacks with the emergence of e-commerce platforms, deployment of cloud solutions, and proliferation of smart devices are some of the factors driving the growth of the market. Cyber threats are anticipated to evolve with the increase in usage of devices with intelligent and IoT technologies. As such, organizations are expected to adopt and deploy advanced cyber security solutions to detect, mitigate, and minimize the risk of cyber-attacks, thereby driving the market growth

Cyber security experienced a slight dip in 2020 due to the closure of several organizations during the first and second quarters of 2020. However, the market started recovering by the end of the second quarter owing to several firms deploying cyber security solutions with the implementation of remote working culture. Employees used personal devices for business work while connecting through private Wi-Fi or anonymous networks, putting the companyâ€™s security at risk. As such, several organizations adopted cyber security solutions the manage and secure the increased number of endpoint devices while also getting protection from network threats.

The market is expected to continue its growing post-pandemic due to the hybrid working trend that is anticipated to stay over the future. Several employees are expected to continue working from home or remote premises with the increasing BYOD trend. According to data published by Nine2FiveJobSearch.com, before the pandemic, 29% of the U.S. workforce had an option of working from home on a part-time basis, which increased to 50% of the workforce working from home in 2020. The risk of cyber-attacks is expected to grow with the emerging BYOD and hybrid working trend, which is expected to drive the adoption of cyber security solutions and fuel market growth.

Several organizations incur significant losses in terms of loss of revenue, brand reputation, unplanned workforce reduction, and business disruptions due to data breaches. Companies have to spend a considerable amount of money to recover from these losses and mitigate the risks evolving from data breaches. According to a report published by IBM in 2021, the average cost of data breaches amounted to USD 4.87 million for an organization, leading to an increase of 10% over 2020. As such, organizations are engaged in deploying advanced cyber security solutions to detect cyber threats and provide a response, thereby helping in cutting down data breach costs.

Cybersecurity companies are engaged in developing security solutions with AI and Machine Learning that helps organizations to automate their IT security. Such solutions enable automated threat detection, allowing IT firms to reduce the efforts and time required to track malicious activities, techniques, and tactics. These solutions offer real-time monitoring and identification of new threats while also providing response autonomously. This helps the security teams analyze the filtered breach information and detect and remediate cyber-attacks faster, thereby reducing security incident costs.
