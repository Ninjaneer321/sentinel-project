### Training of the AI

In the training of this AI we pulling from a lot of resourse, but one book in particular that is very important as to how we go about _teaching_ the AI is called:

**Strategic Teaching and Learning: **_**Cognitive Instruction in the Content Areas**_

### Summary of components

***

### High-level drawing of the architecture

1. Design the database schema to store the various types of data that will be collected by "[The Raven](old-readme.md)" (stock market data, social media posts, budget information, etc.)
2. Implement the data collection nodes for "[The Raven](old-readme.md)", including the front-end, back-end, and API for each node
3. Implement the Open Source Intelligence gathering techniques for "The Raven" to collect contextual data from various sources
4. Develop the machine learning algorithms for "[The Raven](old-readme.md)" and "[Loki](old-readme.md)" to analyze trends and make predictions on contract outcomes and performance
5. Implement "[Heimdall](old-readme.md)" to manage the data sorting and security of the database
6. Implement "[Hermes](old-readme.md)" to efficiently compress, package, and deliver data
7. Implement "[Oden](old-readme.md)" to handle governance, risk, and compliance, and manage security policies
8. Implement "[Thor](old-readme.md)" to respond to security incidents and manage the security of stored and delivered data
9. Implement "[Fandral](old-readme.md)" to monitor network traffic and security, and prevent manipulation of data in transit
10. Implement "[Bragi](old-readme.md)" to manage data storage and retrieval
11. Implement "[Volstagg](old-readme.md)" to manage the overall defensive posture and make suggestions for improvement
12. Implement "[Sif](old-readme.md)" to generate business proposals and other documents, and deliver data on an easy-to-use frontend

_For deployment, you could consider a **rolling deployment strategy**, where you gradually deploy the different components of the system to production, starting with "The Raven" and proceeding through the rest of the components in order. This can help minimize downtime and allow you to catch and fix any issues that arise during deployment._

_As for the cost and labor of the project, it is difficult to provide an accurate estimate without knowing more about the specific technologies and frameworks you will be using, the level of expertise of your team, and the scope of the project in terms of features and functionality._

If you decide to move forward with this plan, some **next steps** could include:

1. Assembling a project team with the necessary skills and expertise to implement the different components of the system
2. Setting up a development and testing environment for the project
3. Defining and prioritizing the features and functionality for the project
4. Developing a project schedule and timeline
5. Procuring any necessary hardware, software, or other resources for the project
6. Setting up a version control system and code repository for the project
7. Setting up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline for the project
8. Establishing project management and communication processes and tools to keep the team organized and on track.

***

## Action Plan

* Develop a roadmap for each of the 8 operations rollout phases that includes:
  * A description with timelines and information to help project managers organize tasks
  * Key focus areas in bullet point form
  * A list of 10 steps to achieve milestones and goals for each phase
  * A weekly task list for the lead project manager to delegate to the team of engineers based on the timeline for the rollout
  * A plan for dividing the team of engineers into sections to achieve a vertical and simultaneous rollout of all project components
  * A list of 10 items for each team to take on and split the workload among themselves, taking into account the timelines for the rollout
* The rollout timeline should be set internally with the goal of delivering the rollout early by taking 2/3 the time of the projected and agreed-upon timeline.

### Engineer considerations

* The team of engineers is young and may benefit from a more fun and gamified approach to their work
* Some of the engineers may be relatively new to this type of project and may need additional resources to accelerate their learning and critical thinking skills
* It would be useful to create guides and manuals for the system and its components, and make them easily accessible to the engineers as needed
* The AI should be able to use machine learning algorithms to help the engineers troubleshoot and solve problems using the same path-finding techniques as the system

Here are some potential focus areas for supporting the engineers:

* Providing resources for learning and skill development
* Gamifying the work to make it more engaging and enjoyable
* Creating guides and manuals for the system and its components
* Ensuring that the AI is able to assist the engineers with troubleshooting and problem-solving
