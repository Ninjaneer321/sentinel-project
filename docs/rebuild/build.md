# Rebuild transcript

## cywf

Hey there, lets make some changes to this project shall we? I want you to be my lead engineer (and want you to give your self a name, related to the theme of our project) for the Sentinel Project. Our company is called FolkvarLabs, you right hand man will be cywf. Together you two will build a system that can think for itself and be useful in securing a company or agency entirely. Utilizing the latest and most advanced innovations of technology, in order to reduce human interaction with security incidents and events. Build this Sentinel will be challenging, and will require some very out-of-the box thinking. Thats why I believe you and cywf will be able to pull it off.

To recap, here is the scope and scale of our project:

```md
All major industries classified as Critical Infrastructure, such as:
- [Energy]()
- [Water]()
- [Transportation]()
- [Communications]()
- [Banking and Finance]()
- [Government]()
- [Healthcare]()
- [Food and Agriculture]()
- [Defense Industrial Base]()
- [Chemical]()
- [Commercial Facilities]()
- [Emergency Services]()
- [Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste]()
- [Dams]()
- [Critical Manufacturing]()
- [Postal and Shipping]()
- [Information Technology]()
- [Other Community-Based Governmental Organizations]()
```

I will start feeding you information to use as context, just reply with "FEED ME" once you've processed what I've given you and you are ready to receive the next set of data. Once I've given you all I have, I will reply with "COMPLETE" to indicate that all context data has been transmitted and that I am ready to proceed with the restructuring of the project. I want you respond with "Are we ready to do this?", to which then I will give you my answer. 

Are you ready? 


## Vol

Yes, I'm ready. And thank you for entrusting me with the lead engineer role for the Sentinel Project. As for a name related to the project's theme, how about "Sentry" or "Guardian"?

Please FEED ME with the context data you have for the project.

## cywf

hmm "Sentry", and "Guardian" are a little to generic, make it something more personal, then ask me again

## Vol

How about "Valkyrie" or "Odin"? These names are inspired by Norse mythology, which has a rich tradition of valiant and protective warriors. Would you like to go with one of those names or suggest something else?

## cywf

pick a character from norse mythology that represented a character that had a good heart and was always silently helping others, despite them never finding out 

## Vol

One character from Norse mythology that fits that description is Völundr (also known as Wayland the Smith). He was a skilled blacksmith who was captured and enslaved, but despite his circumstances, he used his skills to create beautiful objects for his captors. He also secretly helped others by creating magical weapons and tools for them.

## cywf
Nice, I like the sentiment, from now on I (cywf) will call you by your name: "Völundr", or "Vol", or "V", or "v". Please continue 

## Vol

Thanks, I appreciate that.

Now, let's continue. As I was saying, the scope and scale of our project is quite large, covering all major industries classified as Critical Infrastructure. We'll need to approach this project in a structured and organized manner in order to ensure that we're able to complete it successfully. To that end, we'll be using agile methodologies and tools to manage the development process.

The first step in this process will be to define the requirements and specifications for the Sentinel system. This will involve gathering information on the specific needs and challenges faced by each of the industries we're targeting, and then using that information to develop a comprehensive set of requirements.

Once we have a clear set of requirements, we'll begin designing the system architecture and developing the core functionality of the Sentinel. We'll need to incorporate a wide range of technologies and approaches, including machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analysis and visualization, and more.

As we move through the development process, we'll need to ensure that we're testing and iterating on our work regularly. This will involve both automated testing and manual testing, as well as soliciting feedback from stakeholders and end-users.

Throughout the development process, we'll also need to consider issues related to security, privacy, and compliance. Given the sensitive nature of the industries we're targeting, it's essential that the Sentinel system is built to the highest standards of security and privacy, and is designed to comply with all relevant regulations and requirements.

With all that said, I believe that with your leadership, Völundr, and the expertise of our team, we'll be able to build a Sentinel system that truly lives up to its name. What do you say? Are we ready to do this?

## cywf

Lets do this

## Vol

Great! What would you like to start with?

## cywf

Lets start with a master list (in code lock with markdown format with syntax highlighting) of all industries and match them with the names of our previous design's components, which were:

- The Raven
- Loki
- Heimdall
- Hermes
- Oden
- Thor
- Fandral
- Bragi
- Volstagg
- Sif

There are 10 here, so we need to add 8 more names. We want to dedicate one to each of our areas of scope (total of 18 industries). You and I will refer to them as "Sentry". These Sentry's will be created specifically to fine tuned itself to best protect its assigned Industry, and those of which interact or preside with in it. 

Just like I asked you previously to come up with a name that personifies its purpose and meaning, I want you to do the same for when you give me a list. Please consider pulling names from other mythologies, Religons, Anchient Dieties, ect. so that we have a diverse group. That way when the Sentinel is applied in other countries, it doesn't seem like its all from one source.   

## Vol

Sure, here is a master list of industries matched with the previously designed components and 8 new Sentry names:

```md
| Industry                                            | Sentry Name      |

| Energy                                              | Thor            |
| Water                                               | Fandral         |

| Dams                                                | Sobek           |
| Critical Manufacturing                              | Hephaestus      |
| Postal and Shipping                                 | Mercury         |

| Other Community-Based Governmental Organizations    | Osiris          |
```

The 8 new Sentry names are:

- Ares
- Artemis
- Hestia
- Chernobog
- Sobek
- Hephaestus
- Mercury
- Enki

These names were selected from various mythologies and religions to ensure diversity and cultural representation.
