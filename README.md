## What is the Sentinel Project?

The Sentinel Project is a cutting-edge security system that uses the latest technologies and innovative thinking to reduce human interaction with security incidents and events. Designed by FolkvarLabs, the Sentinel Project features a set of highly specialized and fine-tuned "Sentries" that can be deployed to protect various critical infrastructure industries, such as Energy, Water, Transportation, Communications, Banking and Finance, and more.

Each Sentry is designed to think for itself and provide real-time threat intelligence and incident response, ensuring that your infrastructure is always protected from harm. With the Sentinel Project, you can rest assured that your critical infrastructure is secure, even in the face of the most advanced threats.

This repository serves as the main hub for the Sentinel Project, containing all the necessary documentation, source code, and other resources for getting started with the project. Whether you're interested in contributing to the project or just want to learn more about the Sentinel Project and its various Sentries, you'll find everything you need right here.

## High-level drawing of the architecture

<!--
Okay, so now create a detailed draft of how we should go about implementing this in code, give me a summary, deployment rollout strategy, calculate the hours, labor, and cost of the total project. Then give me a summary of next steps, should we decide moving forward with the plan 
-->

1. Design the database schema to store the various types of data that will be collected by "[The Raven]()" (stock market data, social media posts, budget information, etc.)
2. Implement the data collection nodes for "[The Raven]()", including the front-end, back-end, and API for each node
3. Implement the Open Source Intelligence gathering techniques for "The Raven" to collect contextual data from various sources
4. Develop the machine learning algorithms for "[The Raven]()" and "[Loki]()" to analyze trends and make predictions on contract outcomes and performance
5. Implement "[Heimdall]()" to manage the data sorting and security of the database
6. Implement "[Hermes]()" to efficiently compress, package, and deliver data
7. Implement "[Oden]()" to handle governance, risk, and compliance, and manage security policies
8. Implement "[Thor]()" to respond to security incidents and manage the security of stored and delivered data
9. Implement "[Fandral]()" to monitor network traffic and security, and prevent manipulation of data in transit
10. Implement "[Bragi]()" to manage data storage and retrieval
11. Implement "[Volstagg]()" to manage the overall defensive posture and make suggestions for improvement
12. Implement "[Sif]()" to generate business proposals and other documents, and deliver data on an easy-to-use frontend

_For deployment, you could consider a **rolling deployment strategy**, where you gradually deploy the different components of the system to production, starting with "The Raven" and proceeding through the rest of the components in order. This can help minimize downtime and allow you to catch and fix any issues that arise during deployment._

_As for the cost and labor of the project, it is difficult to provide an accurate estimate without knowing more about the specific technologies and frameworks you will be using, the level of expertise of your team, and the scope of the project in terms of features and functionality._

If you decide to move forward with this plan, some **next steps** could include:

1. Assembling a project team with the necessary skills and expertise to implement the different components of the system
2. Setting up a development and testing environment for the project
3. Defining and prioritizing the features and functionality for the project
4. Developing a project schedule and timeline
5. Procuring any necessary hardware, software, or other resources for the project
6. Setting up a version control system and code repository for the project
7. Setting up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline for the project
8. Establishing project management and communication processes and tools to keep the team organized and on track.

# Action Plan

<!--
Okay great, lets start building action plans based off each of the 8 next step items you gave me. From this point on, lets call them our operations rollout phases (the 8 you gave me).

To help our engineers get started, we need to break it down some more. So develop a roadmap for each phase that includes: 
- a description that includes timelines, and information that would be helpful for our project managers to hit the ground running and organize the tasks in lets say Jira or Salesforce
- key focus areas (in a bullet point list)
- a list of 10 steps we need to take to achieve our milestones an goals for that phase
- based off our timeline, divide up the rollout of all phases, and generate a weekly task list that the lead project manager to be able to take and delegate out to our team of engineers
- give a list of how you would divide up the group of engineers into certain sections, so that we successfully achieve a vertical and simultaneous rollout of all components of the project
- then generate a list of 10 items each individual team can take and split the load up amongst the group, that takes account of the timelines we need to meet in order to meet out expected rollout date. 
# Note: whatever our projected timeline is, make it our internal timeline to be to deliver the rollout early, by taking 2/3rds time of the the projected and agreed upon time line.

We can do this one by one, and clarify the details as we go along. 
Please give me a description summary of what I just said, and let me know If I need to clarify anything before we proceed through each section.
-->

* Develop a roadmap for each of the 8 operations rollout phases that includes:
    - A description with timelines and information to help project managers organize tasks
    - Key focus areas in bullet point form
    - A list of 10 steps to achieve milestones and goals for each phase
    - A weekly task list for the lead project manager to delegate to the team of engineers based on the timeline for the rollout
    - A plan for dividing the team of engineers into sections to achieve a vertical and simultaneous rollout of all project components
    - A list of 10 items for each team to take on and split the workload among themselves, taking into account the timelines for the rollout
* The rollout timeline should be set internally with the goal of delivering the rollout early by taking 2/3 the time of the projected and agreed-upon timeline.

<!---
For context:

Our Engineers are young, so we need this to be as fun and gamified and entertaining for them, also some of them are relatively new to this, so we will need to be providing them with the resources needed to accelerate their learning and critical thinking speeds. 

A smart thing we could do is generate guides and manuals of everything in our system and its components, and make it accessible to the engineers immediately at their request. The AI should be able to take their input and use the same path finding / Machine Learning Algorithms used in our system to retrieve the data they need to help them troubleshoot and solve problems that the AI may or may not run into. 

Please respond with a summary of what I just said, and a bulleted list of areas highlighting the potential needs of the engineers, and how to best set them up for success.

After that, lets proceed to break this down one by one. For sanity sake, could you give each of the phases a cool name, sticking with the theme being Norse Mythology, maybe base it off of notable operations/battles/tails that cleverly and subtly reference the project as a whole.
-->

## Engineer considerations

* The team of engineers is young and may benefit from a more fun and gamified approach to their work
* Some of the engineers may be relatively new to this type of project and may need additional resources to accelerate their learning and critical thinking skills
* It would be useful to create guides and manuals for the system and its components, and make them easily accessible to the engineers as needed
* The AI should be able to use machine learning algorithms to help the engineers troubleshoot and solve problems using the same path-finding techniques as the system

Here are some potential focus areas for supporting the engineers:

* Providing resources for learning and skill development
* Gamifying the work to make it more engaging and enjoyable
* Creating guides and manuals for the system and its components
* Ensuring that the AI is able to assist the engineers with troubleshooting and problem-solving
